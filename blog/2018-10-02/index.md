Well, on the second day of ~~Christmas~~ Codectober I wanted to create some simple React app, but to create one, you need create-react-app, that will blown you away from simple code or search for `react boilerplate light`, so I decided create one for me. Barebone. Only React, Styled Components and ESLint stuff. 

Feel free to use it, if you want.
