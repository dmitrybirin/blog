I'm slowly getting back on the coffee road.
Sometimes, when you want to describe the taste of a good cup of coffee, people using `flavor wheel`.
It looks like this:

Well, it's for whisky, but you've got the idea.

Create a chart in vue relatively easy, but the problem is almost all charts for Vue - is ports of other chart libraries, chart.js for example, and they implementation of reactive data is not so easy to grasp.

I wanted interactive one, but maybe I just go with the 20 difference rotated inputs :)

Look at him, he's marvelous!

Will dig into charts the nex codectober day!
