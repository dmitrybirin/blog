Many of my friends are artists, like, real artist and they all gone to _Inktober_ like at war. 
And I don't wanna left them there. So I'll be writing here everyday for next month. 

I've called it ~~Coctober~~ **Codetober**!

The rules are: everyday code something, ship to public and say a couple of words about it.

As a first thing, I did this blog. It's on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org). Gatsby is cool. Use Gatsby.
For the starter blog I used [Gatsby Minibal blog](https://github.com/ahmadawais/gatsby-minimal-blog).
This is great one with Gatsby 2.0 already and good looks.

all you need is 
s
```bash
gatsby new [your-project] https://github.com/ahmadawais/gatsby-minimal-blog
```
and
```bash
gatsby develop
```

And you can start tinkering with React in it.
