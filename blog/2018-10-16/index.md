I just remember that I've already using distance and angle, so I'm already polar as bear.
So instead I've decided added even more interactivity.
I need to reacting on click. And that's different story.

First of all I need to got angle from X and Y - convert cartesian system to polar one.
Then, convert default polar system to one, that chart js using.
Then, understand distance in radians between meaningful labeled rays and clicked point.


Today this:
```javascript

```
