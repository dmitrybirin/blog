So, today the last day of my small 'code-something-everyday' thing.
It was fun:) Even on the second half I mostly develop the same project.

I finally get my hands on:

- mobx-state-tree and state management in common
- Vue
- graph.js + math in javascript
- digital ocean docker droplet
- nginx
- auth 0
- mysql and sequel pro
- koa
- react hooks
- ...

It was pretty packed. There is finally something happening in my GitHUb heat map (halloween color!)

Today, I decided just to watch (finally) Sophie Alpert and Dan Abramov [talk](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889) about React hooks.

1 and half hours later...
I though I will say 'hooks are amazing' and be all hyped.
But I'm not. Hooks are really cool and I definetely try to use them. But I'm not hyped by it. 

And that's actually a really good thing. 

Partly it means, that React are mature enough to not doing rewrites every version and confidently go forward.
Partly it means, that after all tech went through my brain, maybe I've become a little bit mature.

I'll forever save that little kid that curious and open to new things, but be less hyped could be convinient:)

I think I'll stop to write here everyday.
But...

but in a good mood:)

Happy halloween, everybody!
